Yazzo – MVP Plan (Minimum Viable Product)
Yazzo and Yazzo Partner are services provided by Yazzo.io Oy.

1. Objective & Problem Description​
The goal of the Yazzo service is to help event organizers – such as cultural operators and
restaurants – reach customers in real-time, particularly when the event or product is not yet
fully booked. The service enables quick promotion of discounts or visibility precisely at the
moments when participants are most needed.
The problem Yazzo addresses:​
Events and occasions often remain under-attended because their marketing is based on
pre-planned strategies. If ticket sales stall, organizers have no easy way to respond quickly.
Similarly, restaurants may have empty tables or surplus food but lack a channel to attract
customers quickly.
Current alternatives are either too slow (social media, newsletters) or rely on paid ads,
which don’t always convert effectively. They also do not work based on location.
Yazzo offers a solution where real-time discounts and offers are shown on a map to users,
who can immediately make a reservation. This brings value to both businesses and
consumers – especially helping small event organizers to gain visibility and sales without
heavy systems.

2. Vision​
In three years, Yazzo aims to be the leading platform for promoting new experiences and
local services – especially for cultural, event, and restaurant operators. We want to provide a
platform where real-time visibility and agile campaigning are accessible to every organizer,
whether it's a small theatre, a concert, or a dinner. Yazzo transforms the way people
discover experiences – and the way experiences find their audiences.

3. Sustainability​
Yazzo not only improves event visibility and occupancy – it also supports sustainable
development and increases cultural accessibility. The service ensures that existing resources
(such as empty event seats) are fully utilized rather than going unused.
Yazzo promotes the following sustainability goals:
●​ Optimized consumption: Event venues, staff, and production are already in place –
Yazzo enables their more efficient use without additional resource strain.
●​ Improved cultural accessibility: Discounts and real-time offers can make cultural
experiences accessible to those who may not afford full-priced tickets.

●​ Support for small entrepreneurs: Small theatres, performers, and restaurants gain
visibility without large marketing budgets – and can respond flexibly to demand
changes.
●​ Strengthening local identity: The app works based on location, guiding consumers
to use services in their area and boosting urban cultural vibrancy.​

With Yazzo, sustainability is not an add-on – it's built into the core logic of the service: to do
more with less and better utilize existing capacity.
Data Security and GDPR Compliance​
The technical implementation of the Yazzo service is based on the Firebase platform, which
provides high-level security and modern user data management solutions. User data such as
reservations, profile information, and location-based functions are securely stored in
Firestore, and user authentication is handled via Firebase Authentication.
The service is designed and implemented in accordance with the EU’s General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR):
●​ Only data essential for functionality is collected
●​ All personal data is securely stored and minimized technically
●​ Users have the right to view, edit, and delete their information
Data protection and user trust are a fundamental part of the Yazzo user experience – from
the very beginning.

4. Service Overview and Technical Implementation
Service​
Yazzo is a mobile-based platform that allows cultural event organizers to offer real-time
discounts and quickly fill unoccupied seats. Through the service, an event producer can
publish a discount – for example “–50% for tonight’s concert” – which is displayed on the
app’s map view to users. Consumers can reserve the discount directly through the app.
When booking, a small commission is charged from the user, who then receives a personal
discount code and related QR code. This code is used for redemption at the event venue. The
organizer can choose to validate the code manually or scan it via the Yazzo Partner app. If
QR code scanning is not used, the organizer can manually check the code from the Yazzo
Partner app’s reservation list. Both methods mark the reservation as used in the Yazzo
system.
The service combines dynamic pricing, campaign code management, and map-based
visibility to facilitate event filling and improve access to culture for consumers.

Initially, Yazzo focuses on the needs of the culture and event sectors, but the platform is
designed to be scalable. Later, it will expand to the restaurant industry and other
location-based services with unused capacity. In this way, Yazzo becomes a general visibility
and occupancy tool for local experience and service providers.
Yazzo provides a simple, effective, and scalable way to reduce empty seats, track discount
usage, and improve event accessibility – especially for small and medium-sized operators.
Technical Implementation​
Yazzo will be implemented as two separate mobile applications that share the same
backend system:
●​ Yazzo app for end-users (customers)
●​ Yazzo Partner app for managing events and offers (service providers)
Both apps are built using React Native technology and will run on both iOS and Android
platforms, providing a fast, responsive, and user-friendly native experience.
The core of both apps is the map view, which displays real-time event and service discounts
based on the user’s location. The map interface is implemented using Mapbox, offering a
visually clear and easily customizable environment for location-based content.
Backend Architecture (MVP Phase - SLUSH Ready):
●​ Node.js/Express API server deployed on Railway
●​ MySQL database for data persistence
●​ Mock data system for rapid development and demo purposes
●​ Authentication system with multiple options:
  - Google Sign-In (OAuth) via @react-native-google-signin
  - Mock email/password authentication for MVP
  - Future: Firebase Authentication migration post-SLUSH
●​ RESTful API endpoints for events, reservations, and user management
●​ CORS-enabled for cross-platform compatibility

Post-SLUSH Migration Plan:
●​ Firebase Firestore will replace MySQL database
●​ Firebase Authentication will replace mock authentication
●​ Firebase Cloud Functions will handle automated processes
●​ Seamless migration path already architected
The applications communicate through this shared backend, enabling real-time data
synchronization – for example, when an organizer publishes a new offer or a customer
makes a reservation. All content management and event creation is handled exclusively
through the Yazzo Partner app. A separate browser-based admin interface is not built for the
MVP phase.
The application suite enables:
●​
●​
●​
●​

Creation and publishing of events and offers
Real-time visibility on the map
Updating details (e.g., discount changes, extending validity)
Automatic expiration of offers once outdated​

The system is designed to be scalable and rapidly developable at MVP level, and easy to
demo.

5. Authentication Methods
Yazzo supports multiple secure authentication options to accommodate different user preferences:

Google Sign-In (OAuth):
●​ One-click authentication using existing Google accounts
●​ No password management required from users
●​ Secure token-based authentication handled by Firebase
●​ Automatic profile information retrieval (name, email)

Email/Password Registration (MVP Phase):
●​ Mock email and password registration for demo purposes
●​ Local authentication with AsyncStorage for MVP
●​ Simplified registration flow for rapid development
●​ Future: Firebase Authentication with secure password handling post-SLUSH

Both authentication methods provide:
●​ Secure user session management
●​ Automatic token refresh
●​ Consistent user experience across the app
●​ Data protection and privacy compliance

7. Yazzo in a Nutshell​
Yazzo is an ambitious but realistic project that addresses a real need in the cultural and
event sector – and soon also in the restaurant and experience economy. The clearly phased
MVP plan enables fast progress and real user value testing before wider launch.
The service leverages existing technologies effectively, focuses on core functionality, and
genuinely introduces a new way to connect supply and demand in real time. With Yazzo,
empty seats turn into opportunities – and even small players get visibility when it matters
most.
Through collaboration, agile development, and listening to user needs, Yazzo takes its first
steps toward a new, vibrant urban culture.
